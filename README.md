# Description

This repository contains the experiments done as part of the System Software Lab (CSL331) course at KTU University. The experiments cover various topics in system software, including assembly language programming and implementation of assemblers and loaders using the C programming language.

# Contents

- **Pass One Assembler**: Implementation of the pass one algorithm for an assembler in C
- **Pass Two Assembler**: Implementation of the pass two algorithm for an assembler in C
- **Single Pass Assembler**: Implementation of a single pass assembler in C
- **Absolute Loader**: Implementation of an absolute loader in C

# How to use

To run the experiments, you will need a C compiler such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) to build the source code. The instructions for setting up and running the experiments are provided in the individual experiment directories.
